Laboratory
==========

Laboratory is an experimental Firefox extension that helps you generate a proper Content Security Policy (CSP) header for your website.  Simply start recording, browse your site, and enjoy the CSP header that it produces:

It currently requires at least Firefox 53, so works with Dev Edition and should work with Firefox release once version 53 is released.
